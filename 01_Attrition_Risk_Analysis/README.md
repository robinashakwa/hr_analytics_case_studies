# Enterprise Attrition Risk Analysis

## Business Problem
Employee attrition leads to increased replacement costs,
loss of productivity, and operational disruption.
HR leadership needs an early-warning system to identify
employees at high risk of voluntary attrition.

## Objective
- Identify employees at high risk of attrition
- Analyze key drivers such as tenure, engagement, salary, and performance
- Segment employees into risk bands for targeted interventions

## Tools
- SQL (attrition risk logic)
- Excel (cost validation and what-if analysis)
- Power BI (risk and cost dashboards)

## Assumptions
- Attrition is defined as voluntary exits
- Risk score is rule-based and explainable (non-ML)
- Analysis is designed for HR decision support, not prediction accuracy

## Status
SQL logic completed. Excel and Power BI analysis pending.
